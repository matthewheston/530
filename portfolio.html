        This is probably both the simplest and most popular website I have made.
        Based on <a href="http://www.isthereacubsgametoday.com">
          isthereacubsgametoday.com</a>, this is a website that helps people
        trying to get around the south side of Chicago know whether or not they'll
        have to deal with the traffic backups and service disruptions that come
        along with the crowd at U.S. Cellular Field. What I really like about this web app is that
        it demonstrates how a small amount of code  can be used to make something
        extremely useful.

          This project is an attempt at creating a digital version of an
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exquisite_corpse">exquisite
            corpse</a>, an old surrealist technique for creating collaborative
          art. Users invite their friends into a room where they all
          contribute lines to a poem, with the caveat that they only ever see
          the last line the person before them wrote, until the entire poem
          is revealed at the end of the session. There's <a href="http://leonardoflores.net/">
            a lot of interesting projects</a> happening in the digital poetics world.
          exquisite chat is one way I'm trying to explore how the web can be used
          as a medium for creative expression and collaboration.

            This network visualization displays crimes that occurred in Chicago
            on June 24, 2012, one of the days with the most violent crimes of
            the year.
            <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/">The City of Chicago Data
              Portal</a> makes a lot of data available. My hope is that visualizations
            like this encourage users to interact with and explore the data in ways
            that are not possible through traditional interfaces. I think this
            also represents what I consider an exciting new place in web standards,
            where developers are able to create interesting and novel interfaces and
            data visualizations that are available to anyone with a web browser.

            This is a purely client side project making use of
            <a href="http://d3js.org/">d3</a>, based on Jim Vallandingham's
            <a href="http://flowingdata.com/2012/08/02/how-to-make-an-interactive-network-visualization/">
              tutorial</a> on making network visualizations. A Ruby script
            was used to transform the JSON from the Chicago data portal into
            a form more easily consumed by d3.
