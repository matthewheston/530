<b>Hi, I'm Matt.</b>
<p>
  I'm interested in social aspects of computing and technology. I develop
  novel applications and interfaces that I hope result in more engaged users,
  whether they are exploring civic data or writing collaborative poetry. I
  also research how people use existing technologies to collaborate and communicate
  with one another. I want to use the web as a platform both to create new
  ways for people to interact as well as to explore the ways they currently do.
</p>
<p>
  I'm currently a graduate student in a technical communication department
  at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago. I received my undergraduate
  degree in Computer Information Systems, and I have worked professionally as
  a software developer. I think my background in programming gives me a unique
  perspective and skill set to bring to the study of communication practices
  and information design.

<p>
  In addition to writing code and research, I also write poems and literary
  essays, along with jokes that I sometimes perform in front of strangers
  at open mics around the city.
