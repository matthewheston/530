      <b>Hi, I'm Matt.</b>
      <p>
        I'm currently a graduate student studying information architecture in
        Chicago. My background is in computer information systems, and I worked
        as a professional software developer before coming back to school.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm interested in novel applications of technology to make users more
        engaged, whether they're exploring civic data or writing a collaborative
        poem. I want to use the web as a platform both to create new ways
        for people to interact with data and with each other, as well to explore
        the ways people use existing technology to do those things.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to writing code and research, I also write poems and literary
        essays, along with jokes that I sometimes perform in front of strangers
        at open mics around the city.
      </p>
